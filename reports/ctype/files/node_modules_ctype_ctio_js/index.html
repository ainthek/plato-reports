 *
 * A simple way to read and write simple ctypes. Of course, as you&#039;ll find the
 * code isn&#039;t as simple as it might appear. The following types are currently
 * supported in big and little endian formats:
 *
 * 	uint8_t			int8_t
 * 	uint16_t		int16_t
 * 	uint32_t		int32_t
 *	float (single precision IEEE 754)
 *	double (double precision IEEE 754)
 *
 * This is designed to work in Node and v8. It may in fact work in other
 * Javascript interpreters (that&#039;d be pretty neat), but it hasn&#039;t been tested.
 * If you find that it does in fact work, that&#039;s pretty cool. Try and pass word
 * back to the original author.
 *
 * Note to the reader: If you&#039;re tabstop isn&#039;t set to 8, parts of this may look
 * weird.

/*
 * Numbers in Javascript have a secret: all numbers must be represented with an
 * IEEE-754 double. The double has a mantissa with a length of 52 bits with an
 * implicit one. Thus the range of integers that can be represented is limited
 * to the size of the mantissa, this makes reading and writing 64-bit integers
 * difficult, but far from impossible.
 *
 * Another side effect of this representation is what happens when you use the
 * bitwise operators, i.e. shift left, shift right, and, or, etc. In Javascript,
 * each operand and the result is cast to a signed 32-bit number. However, in
 * the case of &gt;&gt;&gt; the values are cast to an unsigned number.

/*
 * Signed integer types, yay team! A reminder on how two&#039;s complement actually
 * works. The first bit is the signed bit, i.e. tells us whether or not the
 * number should be positive or negative. If the two&#039;s complement value is
 * positive, then we&#039;re done, as it&#039;s equivalent to the unsigned representation.
 *
 * Now if the number is positive, you&#039;re pretty much done, you can just leverage
 * the unsigned translations and return those. Unfortunately, negative numbers
 * aren&#039;t quite that straightforward.
 *
 * At first glance, one might be inclined to use the traditional formula to
 * translate binary numbers between the positive and negative values in two&#039;s
 * complement. (Though it doesn&#039;t quite work for the most negative value)
 * Mainly:
 *  - invert all the bits
 *  - add one to the result
 *
 * Of course, this doesn&#039;t quite work in Javascript. Take for example the value
 * of -128. This could be represented in 16 bits (big-endian) as 0xff80. But of
 * course, Javascript will do the following:
 *
 * &gt; ~0xff80
 * -65409
 *
 * Whoh there, Javascript, that&#039;s not quite right. But wait, according to
 * Javascript that&#039;s perfectly correct. When Javascript ends up seeing the
 * constant 0xff80, it has no notion that it is actually a signed number. It
 * assumes that we&#039;ve input the unsigned value 0xff80. Thus, when it does the
 * binary negation, it casts it into a signed value, (positive 0xff80). Then
 * when you perform binary negation on that, it turns it into a negative number.
 *
 * Instead, we&#039;re going to have to use the following general formula, that works
 * in a rather Javascript friendly way. I&#039;m glad we don&#039;t support this kind of
 * weird numbering scheme in the kernel.
 *
 * (BIT-MAX - (unsigned)val + 1) * -1
 *
 * The astute observer, may think that this doesn&#039;t make sense for 8-bit numbers
 * (really it isn&#039;t necessary for them). However, when you get 16-bit numbers,
 * you do. Let&#039;s go back to our prior example and see how this will look:
 *
 * (0xffff - 0xff80 + 1) * -1
 * (0x007f + 1) * -1
 * (0x0080) * -1
 *
 * Doing it this way ends up allowing us to treat it appropriately in
 * Javascript. Sigh, that&#039;s really quite ugly for what should just be a few bit
 * shifts, ~ and &amp;.

 * We now move onto IEEE 754: The traditional form for floating point numbers
 * and what is secretly hiding at the heart of everything in this. I really hope
 * that someone is actually using this, as otherwise, this effort is probably
 * going to be more wasted.
 *
 * One might be tempted to use parseFloat here, but that wouldn&#039;t work at all
 * for several reasons. Mostly due to the way floats actually work, and
 * parseFloat only actually works in base 10. I don&#039;t see base 10 anywhere near
 * this file.
 *
 * In this case we&#039;ll implement the single and double precision versions. The
 * quadruple precision, while probably useful, wouldn&#039;t really be accepted by
 * Javascript, so let&#039;s not even waste our time.
 *
 * So let&#039;s review how this format looks like. A single precision value is 32
 * bits and has three parts:
 *   -  Sign bit
 *   -  Exponent (Using bias notation)
 *   -  Mantissa
 *
 * |s|eeeeeeee|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
 * 31| 30-23  |  22    	-       0       |
 *
 * The exponent is stored in a biased input. The bias in this case 127.
 * Therefore, our exponent is equal to the 8-bit value - 127.
 *
 * By default, a number is normalized in IEEE, that means that the mantissa has
 * an implicit one that we don&#039;t see. So really the value stored is 1.m.
 * However, if the exponent is all zeros, then instead we have to shift
 * everything to the right one and there is no more implicit one.
 *
 * Special values:
 *  - Positive Infinity:
 *	Sign:		0
 *	Exponent: 	All 1s
 *	Mantissa:	0
 *  - Negative Infinity:
 *	Sign:		1
 *	Exponent: 	All 1s
 *	Mantissa:	0
 *  - NaN:
 *	Sign:		*
 *	Exponent: 	All 1s
 *	Mantissa:	non-zero
 *  - Zero:
 *	Sign:		*
 *	Exponent:	All 0s
 *	Mantissa:	0
 *
 * In the case of zero, the sign bit determines whether we get a positive or
 * negative zero. However, since Javascript cannot determine the difference
 * between the two: i.e. -0 == 0, we just always return 0.

 * We now move onto our friends in the signed number category. Unlike unsigned

 * arrays. Since we are only worrying about signed 32-bit values, we&#039;re in
 * slightly better shape. Unfortunately, we really can&#039;t do our favorite binary
 * &amp; in this system. It really seems to do the wrong thing. For example:
 *
 * &gt; -32 &amp; 0xff
 * 224
 *
 * What&#039;s happening above is really: 0xe0 &amp; 0xff = 0xe0. However, the results of
 * this aren&#039;t treated as a signed number. Ultimately a bad thing.
 *
 * What we&#039;re going to want to do is basically create the unsigned equivalent of
 * our representation and pass that off to the wuint* functions. To do that
 * we&#039;re going to do the following:
 *
 *  - if the value is positive
 *	we can pass it directly off to the equivalent wuint
 *  - if the value is negative
 *	we do the following computation:
 *	mb + val + 1, where
 *	mb	is the maximum unsigned value in that byte size
 *	val	is the Javascript negative integer
 *
 *
 * As a concrete value, take -128. In signed 16 bits this would be 0xff80. If
 * you do out the computations:
 *
 * 0xffff - 128 + 1
 * 0xffff - 127
 * 0xff80
 *
 * You can then encode this value as the signed version. This is really rather
 * hacky, but it should work and get the job done which is our goal here.
 *
 * Thus the overall flow is:
 *   -  Truncate the floating point part of the number
 *   -  We don&#039;t have to take the modulus, because the unsigned versions will
 *   	take care of that for us. And we don&#039;t have to worry about that
 *   	potentially causing bad things to happen because of sign extension
 *   -  Pass it off to the appropriate unsigned version, potentially modifying
 *	the negative portions as necessary.

 * Now we are moving onto the weirder of these, the float and double. For this

 * have no way to get at the underlying float representation, at least not
 * easily. But that doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t figure it out, we just have to use our
 * heads.
 *
 * One might propose to use Number.toString(2). Of course, this is not really
 * that good, because the ECMAScript 262 v3 Standard says the following Section
 * 15.7.4.2-Number.prototype.toString (radix):
 *
 * If radix is an integer from 2 to 36, but not 10, the result is a string, the
 * choice of which is implementation-dependent.
 *
 * Well that doesn&#039;t really help us one bit now does it? We could use the
 * standard base 10 version of the string, but that&#039;s just going to create more
 * errors as we end up trying to convert it back to a binary value. So, really
 * this just means we have to be non-lazy and parse the structure intelligently.
 *
 * First off, we can do the basic checks: NaN, positive and negative infinity.
 *
 * Now that those are done we can work backwards to generate the mantissa and
 * exponent.
 *
 * The first thing we need to do is determine the sign bit, easy to do, check
 * whether the value is less than 0. And convert the number to its absolute
 * value representation. Next, we need to determine if the value is less than
 * one or greater than or equal to one and from there determine what power was
 * used to get there. What follows is now specific to floats, though the general
 * ideas behind this will hold for doubles as well, but the exact numbers
 * involved will change.
 *
 * Once we have that power we can determine the exponent and the mantissa. Call
 * the value that has the number of bits to reach the power ebits. In the
 * general case they have the following values:
 *
 *	exponent	127 + ebits
 *	mantissa	value * 2^(23 - ebits) &amp; 0x7fffff
 *
 * In the case where the value of ebits is &lt;= -127 we are now in the case where
 * we no longer have normalized numbers. In this case the values take on the
 * following values:
 *
 * 	exponent	0
 *	mantissa	value * 2^149 &amp; 0x7fffff
 *
 * Once we have the values for the sign, mantissa, and exponent. We reconstruct
 * the four bytes as follows:
 *
 *	byte0		sign bit and seven most significant bits from the exp
 *			sign &lt;&lt; 7 | (exponent &amp; 0xfe) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1
 *
 *	byte1		lsb from the exponent and 7 top bits from the mantissa
 *			(exponent &amp; 0x01) &lt;&lt; 7 | (mantissa &amp; 0x7f0000) &gt;&gt;&gt; 16
 *
 *	byte2		bits 8-15 (zero indexing) from mantissa
 *			mantissa &amp; 0xff00 &gt;&gt; 8
 *
 *	byte3		bits 0-7 from mantissa
 *			mantissa &amp; 0xff
 *
 * Once we have this we have to assign them into the buffer in proper endian

 * Now we move onto doubles. Doubles are similar to floats in pretty much all
 * ways except that the processing isn&#039;t quite as straightforward because we
 * can&#039;t always use shifting, i.e. we have &gt; 32 bit values.
 *
 * We&#039;re going to proceed in an identical fashion to floats and utilize the same
 * helper functions. All that really is changing are the specific values that we
 * use to do the calculations. Thus, to review we have to do the following.
 *
 * First get the sign bit and convert the value to its absolute value
 * representation. Next, we determine the number of bits that we used to get to
 * the value, branching whether the value is greater than or less than 1. Once
 * we have that value which we will again call ebits, we have to do the
 * following in the general case:
 *
 *	exponent	1023 + ebits
 *	mantissa	[value * 2^(52 - ebits)] % 2^52
 *
 * In the case where the value of ebits &lt;= -1023 we no longer use normalized
 * numbers, thus like with floats we have to do slightly different processing:
 *
 *	exponent	0
 *	mantissa	[value * 2^1074] % 2^52
 *
 * Once we have determined the sign, exponent and mantissa we can construct the
 * bytes as follows:
 *
 *	byte0		sign bit and seven most significant bits form the exp
 *			sign &lt;&lt; 7 | (exponent &amp; 0x7f0) &gt;&gt;&gt; 4
 *
 *	byte1		Remaining 4 bits from the exponent and the four most
 *			significant bits from the mantissa 48-51
 *			(exponent &amp; 0x00f) &lt;&lt; 4 | mantissa &gt;&gt;&gt; 48
 *
 *	byte2		Bits 40-47 from the mantissa
 *			(mantissa &gt;&gt;&gt; 40) &amp; 0xff
 *
 *	byte3		Bits 32-39 from the mantissa
 *			(mantissa &gt;&gt;&gt; 32) &amp; 0xff
 *
 *	byte4		Bits 24-31 from the mantissa
 *			(mantissa &gt;&gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xff
 *
 *	byte5		Bits 16-23 from the Mantissa
 *			(mantissa &gt;&gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xff
 *
 *	byte6		Bits 8-15 from the mantissa
 *			(mantissa &gt;&gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff
 *
 *	byte7		Bits 0-7 from the mantissa
 *			mantissa &amp; 0xff
 *
 * Now we can&#039;t quite do the right shifting that we want in bytes 1 - 3, because
 * we&#039;ll have extended too far and we&#039;ll lose those values when we try and do
 * the shift. Instead we have to use an alternate approach. To try and stay out
 * of floating point, what we&#039;ll do is say that mantissa -= bytes[4-7] and then
 * divide by 2^32. Once we&#039;ve done that we can use binary arithmetic. Oof,
 * that&#039;s ugly, but it seems to avoid using floating point (just based on how v8
 * seems to be optimizing for base 2 arithmetic).
